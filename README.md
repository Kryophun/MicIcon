# MicIcon

## Installation instructions
Download `MicIcon_<version>.zip`. Extract and run setup to install. If you have a previous version installed, you may need to uninstall it first.

As of 1.0.0.3, you will need to redo the setting to make the icon appear in the system tray all the time after updating.

## Set icon to appear all the time in system tray
1. Right-click on the taskbar and choose Taskbar settings.
2. In the "Notification area" section, click "Select which icons appear on the taskbar".
3. Toggle "MicIcon" to On. (There may be multiple MicIcon entries, i.e. "MicIcon.exe". You can leave that one off.)


## Enable automatic running at startup
* Press Win+R to open the Run command.
* Type `shell:startup`
* Click OK or press Enter.
* Copy a shortcut to the application. To find the installation location:
  * Find the program in the Start menu (likely will be under Recently Added near the top).
  * Right-click on MicIcon and choose More > Open file location.
  * Copy the MicIcon and paste it in the Startup folder.
